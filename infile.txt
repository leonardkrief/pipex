Errors to setup:

If infile does not exist, "$(file name): No such file or directory\n"
setup errno = 2
Then we need to setup the infile to something. In real shell, piped commands execute so maybe /dev/stdin but im not sure. Should test if cat stays on hold

If infile exists but no read access, "$(file name): Permission denied\n"
setup errno = 13

If outfile exists but no write access, "$(file name): Permission denied\n"
setup errno = 13

If cmd does not exist: "$(cmd name): command not found\n"
no errno value for that so have to printf ?

If cmd exists but has no exec right: "$(cmd name): Permission denied\n"
setup errno = 13
